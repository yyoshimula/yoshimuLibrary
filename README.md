# yoshimuLibrary

This repository contains MATLAB code and data for various simulations, estimation algorithms, and control models developed in the context of spacecraft engineering and orbital mechanics research.

Main applications include:
- attitude representations and their transformation (e.g., Euler angles to quaternions)
- Light curve-based attitude estimation
- Solar sail dynamics modeling
- Orbit estimation and filtering (e.g., Kalman Filter, UKF, CKF, etc.)
